            <h2>Our Public-Benefit Purpose</h2>
            <p>
              Healthy Weight Literacy Foundation is organized and operated exclusively for educational and public-benefit
              purposes. Our work is focused on improving public understanding of weight health, obesity, and
              evidence-based health information. We exist to make accurate health information more accessible — not to
              generate revenue, sell products, or provide individualized medical services.
            </p>

            <h2>How We Use Our Resources</h2>
            <p>
              Resources received by the Foundation are directed toward activities consistent with our educational
              mission. These include:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Developing and maintaining educational content on weight health topics</li>
              <li>Public outreach and awareness efforts</li>
              <li>Website operations and content accessibility</li>
              <li>Organizational governance and compliance</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              We do not operate commercial programs, sell advertising, or generate revenue through affiliate arrangements
              as a primary function. Any future funding relationships will be disclosed in a manner consistent with
              nonprofit best practices.
            </p>

            <h2>Nonprofit Status</h2>

            </p>

            <h2>Governance</h2>

            </p>

            <h2>Separation of Content and Funding</h2>

              We are committed to maintaining a clear separation between our educational content and any organizational
              funding sources or partnerships. Our editorial and content decisions are guided by our educational mission,
              not by funding relationships. For more on how we develop content, see our{" "}
