      <p>
        The Healthy Weight Literacy Foundation publishes educational content about healthy weight, obesity as a chronic
        disease, metabolic health, weight-related conditions, nutrition, and related consumer health topics.
      </p>
      <p>
        This page describes the standards that govern what we publish, how we make editorial decisions, and what we will
        not publish.
      </p>

      <h2 id="mission-and-purpose">Our Mission and Editorial Purpose</h2>
      <p>Our purpose is education, not promotion.</p>
      <p>
        Every article we publish is intended to help patients, caregivers, and consumers make better-informed
        decisions — not to sell products, drive clinical referrals, or advance any commercial interest. The Foundation
        does not accept advertising, does not accept sponsored content, and does not receive compensation from
        pharmaceutical manufacturers, supplement companies, or any other commercial entity in exchange for editorial
        coverage.
      </p>
      <p>
        When we cover a medication, provider type, or product category, we do so because the topic is relevant to our
        readers&apos; health decisions — not because anyone paid us to cover it.
      </p>

      <h2 id="what-we-cover">What We Cover</h2>
      <p>We publish educational content across these topic areas:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          GLP-1 medications and other obesity medications — mechanisms, evidence, patient guidance, access, and cost
        </li>
        <li>
          Obesity as a chronic disease — biology, stigma, and the scientific evidence base
        </li>
        <li>
          Metabolic health — including blood sugar regulation, insulin resistance, and related conditions
        </li>
        <li>Nutrition and protein guidance for people managing their weight</li>
        <li>Exercise literacy for people with obesity or overweight</li>
        <li>
          Compound pharmacy literacy and what patients should understand about non-FDA-approved formulations
        </li>
        <li>Weight loss scams, deceptive marketing, and consumer protection</li>
        <li>Patient advocacy, weight stigma, and behavioral support</li>
        <li>Mindset and long-term weight management</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="what-we-do-not-cover">What We Do Not Cover</h2>
      <p>We do not publish:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Sponsored or advertiser-influenced content of any kind</li>
        <li>Promotional reviews of specific commercial products or services</li>
        <li>Content that recommends a specific medication or intervention for a specific person</li>
        <li>Articles designed to generate leads for any commercial entity</li>
        <li>
          Miracle framing, before-and-after narratives designed to create false expectations, or sensationalized
          health claims
        </li>
        <li>Content that presents unproven approaches as established medical fact</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="medical-claims">How We Handle Medical Claims</h2>
      <p>We treat medical claim accuracy as the highest editorial priority.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Claims about medication or intervention efficacy are attributed to named published sources (clinical trials,
          FDA prescribing information, peer-reviewed journals, major health authority publications)
        </li>
        <li>
          We distinguish between what the evidence establishes and what is still uncertain or debated
        </li>
        <li>We do not present off-label medication use as routine or universally safe</li>
        <li>
          We include medical disclaimers on all content involving clinical decisions or medications
        </li>
        <li>
          We identify the specific type of evidence behind major claims (clinical trial, meta-analysis, observational
          study, expert consensus, etc.)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        When evidence is limited or conflicting, we say so clearly rather than presenting false certainty.
      </p>

      <h2 id="corrections">Corrections Policy</h2>
      <p>
        When an error is identified in published content — factual, interpretive, or attributional — we correct it
        promptly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Corrections are made to the live article. Significant corrections include a correction notice at the top of the
        article describing what changed and when. Minor corrections (grammar, spelling, broken links) are made without
        notice.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you believe an article contains an error, contact us at{" "}
        <a href={`mailto:${siteConfig.email}`}>{siteConfig.email}</a>.
      </p>

      <h2 id="content-review">Content Review and Updates</h2>
      <p>
        Health information changes. Medications receive new warnings. Coverage policies shift. Clinical guidelines are
        revised.
      </p>
      <p>
        We assign each published article a review date based on how quickly the underlying information is likely to
        change:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Articles covering medication mechanisms and chronic disease biology are reviewed every 24 months
        </li>
        <li>
          Articles covering medications, clinical outcomes, and patient guidance are reviewed every 12 months
        </li>
        <li>
          Articles covering drug access and regulatory developments are reviewed every 3 months
        </li>
        <li>
          Articles covering scam alerts, FDA actions, and regulatory developments are reviewed monthly
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Review dates are shown in the article footer. Articles that have passed their review date are flagged
        internally for update before continued promotion.
      </p>
